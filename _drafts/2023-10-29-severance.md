macro data refinement: job to refine "bad" numbers that looked "scary"
did anyone else think of belly buttons when they said innies and outties

"since this perceptual version of you only exists at lumon, i mean quitting would effectively end your life!"

"i know your innie would have been sad to miss the day" - underhanded guilt tripping

minor mistakes such as "dozing" seems to have disproportionate punishments

quite a slow burn.

tackles themes as identity, draws parallel to split personality, techno-utopianism

wanted more "thrill" considering they call themself a sci-fi psychological thriller . ended with a cliff hanger on ep 9. i thought there would be a ep10! but looks like season 2 was renewed

would have rated higher if werent for the fact that it was kinda predictable. helly R was clearly someone more important than a regular employee. why would a company go to all the trouble to keep her in. The more interesting storyline was mark's wife. apparently he severed to help deal with grief, but it turns out that his wife Ms Casey is in Lumon working as a wellness consellor! what is even stranger is that she does not work normal hours, and is only awake for maybe 30 mins at a time. Wonder who she is on the outside. Of course both mark and ms casey don't know that they were married, which further adds to the mystery.
