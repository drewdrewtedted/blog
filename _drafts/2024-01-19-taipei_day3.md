It's friday! the busiest day of the trip awaits. I woke up at 7.45 and immediately rushed to the beitou dapao chang. i was just in time 8.55. there was supposedly another 2 people but they didnt turn up. i started the climbing first while one lady stayed behind to wait for them. There was a short hike before reaching the actual rock climbing wall. it was pretty steep and not very well traveled. some steps were soft and gave way very easily. luckily, it wasn't a very long hike, maybe around 5-10min. We started on the easiest wall first, while i managed to scale up quickly on my first try. no biggie! didn't manage to record this unfortunately. Took a break before attempted the second wall, which was considerably harder. When you are on the wall, it is much harder to spot the usable holes. i failed the first time and took a rest before attempting. The instructor's friend (?) gave it a try and showed me how to do it. While resting, many elderly walked by as part of their hiking route and started to chit chat. it was kinda surprsing because i would say the trail was pretty tough, maybe too tough for older people. but i guess i was wrong haha. anyway it was pretty amusing because they also wanted to try rock climbing haha. anyway the instructor said no. i tried again on the second wall. didn't follow the "proper" route and went for an unorthodox route. but i still got to the top-ish haha. then we moved on to the 3rd wall which was super hard. there was a small ceiling on the rock and you had to streeeeeetch upwards while your body at a 45 degrees angle. failed the first time. then tried again. anyway the lady was waiting for the two latecomers ended up waiting for 1 hour before coming up. wow she had such patience. i tried the 3rd wall again but failed (verify again). then rest.then instructor told me to use an easier way to climb up the wall which i did

after we were done with the climb the instructor brought us up to the top of the walls which hard pretty good views! hidden gem. the hike up and down was a little dangerous as well, almost slipped and fall. it was really good! i enjoyed this activity tremendously.

after that i wanted to go the beitou hot spring nearby. so i walked down from the dapao meeting point to the onsen. along the way, i found a spot i could use my drone with. it was really beautiful! a random guy who also played with drones before also came to talk to me and gave me some recommendations on where to fly. i didn't follow them because it was little far and i was kinda tired. so i played a little with my drone then headed to the emporor spa.

i took the public bath, it was around 250ntd. the outdoors sauna had a cold bath, and 6 warm bath. i would say it was pretty crowded, more than 30 people when i reached at 2pm. i didn't stay long, soaking in hot springs is not really my thing. but the bath was a good respite after the rock climb.

then i booked an uber to my next activity at he shuang. started to chat a little with the lady driver and i asked for food recommendations. i told her i hadnt eaten the whole day and planned to look for food near the river. she was pretty shocked and told me there were no food at all near the river and i should go eat nearby. she insisted that i change my location to somewhere nearer. she recommended a gyoza shop called a cai guo tie. she was so nice! a cai guo tie was located in a small neighbourhood with its own quiet charm. it wasnt very bustling but there were some street food stalls scattered in the area. i had 10 guo tie for 75 ntd. the guo ties were okay i guess, would rate it 6/10. explored the area and had a chocolate pancake similar to mr bean for 20 ntd. was ok, 6/10. also had a lu rou fan for 30 ntd. there was practically no meat, but it was actually kinda flavourful. 6/10.

I bought some milk at the nearby family mart. people-watched a little, mostly listening to 4 kids having their after-school gathering lol, before heading over to my original destination - heshuang 




heshuang was really beautiful! the river was clean and people were fishing at the side. did some drone shots, really beautiful! the bike lanes were wide and people were cycling in the area and enjoying the cool breeze. at 3.55pm i found the instructor and we started SUP.

SUP, or stand up paddleboarding, is actually pretty fun. it is not very intense or rigorous compared to say surfing. The instructor owned the whole business and i was again the only person doing the activity. He thought me the basics, which reminded me of a mix of kayaking (the paddling) and surfing (the board handling). It was a pretty chill activity. However the challenge was not to fall into the river. Unlike surfing where it is expected to be fully wet, SUP relies on your balance to stay afloat on the board. I wasn't afraid of falling into the river, but i think the self imposed challenge of not getting wet made it more exciting. there were 3 positions one could do on the board- sitting, kneeling, and standing. kneeling was the most comfortable for me. standing was the hardest and my knees were wobbling all the time. not sure if its because i was tired or i was cold. in addition, the wind was really strong! I had a good chat with the 24yo instructor and he said he wanted to introduce SUP to more people in taipei. he wanted to fight against the stigma from elderly that wan sui/play water is dangerous. he also constantly made sure i understood the safety instructions and made sure i was safe from any artifacts in the river. so he was thorough and conscientious! This activity is definitely doable for elderly (maybe not the standing position haha), but the sitting and kneeling position is actually v chill and relaxing. had a great chit chat with the friendly instructor. enjoyed this activity tremendously as well.

Anyway i decided to head back to the hotel since i lost my change of clothes. initially wanted to visit shilin night market but i'll save that for another day. took a cab back.

rested a while then went looking for dinner at xmd! friday night is so much more crowded! TIL the street stalls were illegal and they would rush to the side when the police came. police were quite strict today so they were displaced from their original locations and they were quite angsty about it. wandered around a while more, got another cong you bing, papaya milk, and tried out a random niu rou mian stall. street stalls feel different because you eat in fromt of the cook, compliments and comments are paid directly to the cook. itâ€™s a much more intimate affair compared to a restaurant. listened to some bustlers before calling it a day
