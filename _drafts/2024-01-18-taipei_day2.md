I woke up excited for my second day in Taipei. I designated day 2 as a chill day since day 1 was supposedly tiring because of the day trip. The only thing on my itinerary today was a [free walking tour on Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/10199-free-walking-tour-golden-age-route-taipei/?aid=54315). Since I didn't have anything planned this morning, I decided to visit a community gym short walk 15 minute away in yuquan 玉泉. 


## Yuquan Gym (玉泉公園健身房) and Ximending (西門町) | 11am

The walk from my hotel to yuquan gym was leisurely and enjoyable. The gym was small but clean and new, and there were a few locals getting their workout in. I spent about an hour there, nothing too vigorous because i was feeling a little lazy haha. Considering it was only 50ntd/h, it was pretty worth it!

After my workout, i strolled back to ximending, enjoying the hustle and bustle of the morning taipei life. The day has just started for many shops in XMD.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/ahchung.jpeg){: width="230" height="355" .right} I noticed a brief line forming outside Ay-Chung Flour-Rice Noodle (阿宗麵線) and decided to join in for a small bowl. The unassuming simplicity of the dish was delightful, especially on this chilly day. The broth had a tangy kick, and the noodles were wonderfully tender. With each spoonful, a wave of nostalgic comfort washed over me. Though I couldn't help but wish for a bit more meat. While vermicelli (麵線/mianxian) is commonly associated with Taiwan, variations of these thin rice noodles can also be found in other Asian cuisines such as Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine, each with its own unique preparation and flavor profile. This particular bowl of vermicelli tasted similar to taiwanese vermicelli in Singapore.

I spent some time exploring ximending with the intention of getting some soy milk and dough fritters (豆漿油條/doujiangyoutiao). It's a comfort food for many Taiwanese people, evoking memories of childhood breakfasts or early morning visits to local street vendors. In Singapore, it is not so much a breakfast food, but rather a snack. In addition, it is more common to just eat the dough fritter by itself, without the soy milk (at least in my experience). However, i was too late. Breakfast food apparently stops selling at 12pm. To make up for it, i got myself mango milk for 100NTD, but for its price i would honestly rather just get papaya or avocado milk.


<!-- after gym i went back to XMD. walked around and had this ah zhong mian xian for 60 ntd. not bad, 7/10. the day has just started for many shops and i saw an older guy do his morning prayers outside his shop. walked around a while more and came across this oyster omelette place. i think its way too much for me so i didnt get it. had mango milk for 100ntd, not bad 7/10 but kinda expensive. wandered around a while more, and wanted to get doujiangyoutiao. but it was too late! (12pm). shall try to return earlier next time.  -->

My day so far has been really pleasant. It might be the cool breezy weather which humid Singapore sorely lacks, or the amicable gracious vibes of taipei, but navigating the roads on food here is lovely. Pet/street dogs are common and seem to be loved and accepted by the locals. I went searching for more food and tried out a pork sausage. A little too oily for my liking, but it was still an enjoyable sinful treat.

Wanted to give luroufan another chance, so i followed this billboard to a secluded corridor in a building. the granny in the corridor with her bulldog told me that the shop didnt sell luroufan anymore, but they had a better alternative. hong shao rou fan! according to her, the braised meat in hong shao rou fan come in larger blocks, making it nicer. she aint wrong. i made a turn into the corridor to discover a quaint little shop. bought the hong shao rou fan for 90 NTD. not bad 7/10! the larger portion size is more satisfying and fills you up better, but i don't think it is any nicer than luo rou fan. 

Up next was XLBs from the xingfutang collaboration


<!-- unsure if it is the weather or the vibes, but wandering here is very pleasant. dogs are pretty common and seems to be accepted even in shops and buildings. had a pork sausage for 50NTD, it was ok, 6/10. went looking for luroufan. followed one random advertisement into a quiet corridor. the granny in the corridor with her bulldog told me that the shop didnt sell luroufan anymore, but they had a better alternative. hong shao rou fan! according to her, the braised meat in hong shao rou fan come in larger blocks, making it nicer. she aint wrong. i made a turn into the corridor to discover a quaint little shop. bought the hong shao rou fan for 90 NTD. not bad 7/10! but i don't think it is any nicer than luo rou fan, just portion sizing is different. went back out, and tried the xiao long baos 120NTD from a shop opened by the famous xingfutang bubble tea shop. honestly it was kinda mediocre, maybe 5.5/10. wouldnt rlly return or recommend. i didnt get to try the special brown sugar boba xlb though, it was sold out. -->

walked around a while more and happened onto this manga/anime/weeb/otaku store. they also sold yaoi in there haha. there were 3 floors, and level 1 and 2 were mostly mangas. level 3 had figurines. other than the usual demon slayer/jujutsu kaisen merch, i surprisngly found made in abyss merch! i didnt even know they had merch. also while browsing a family came in with their shiba and baby haha. i ended up buying a nanachi plushie 320ntd(which i regret) and a nanachi figurine 1130 ntd (which i don't). went back at 2 for a quick shower before realizing my walking tour was at 3pm


## Golden Age Walking Tour

I found this [free walking tour on Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/10199-free-walking-tour-golden-age-route-taipei/?aid=54315)

at 2.40pm, i walked quickly to beimen station for the walking tour. the tour was pretty interesting and it was an introduction to the history of several taipei buildings or locations such as the north/west gate or the postoffice. 

we also went to the Taipei Xia Hai City God temple which had an unusual design. most temples start on the ground floor but this particular one did not. apparently, using the jiaobei/moon blocks, the god apparently did not want to be moved. however, the taipei administration wanted to build a road to facilitate easier trade. so they decided to raise the temple. one guy came forward to ask the god a question, and he got the same answer 3 times (smiling answer)!


forgot this part/ review footage. teahouse/ 228 incident/ white terror

after that we walked over to yongle. an buslting little neighbourhood with very little tourists. really liked this area! took a 10 min break here. then we walked to temple Taipei Xiahai Chenghuang Temple where people pray to "yue lao"/ old man under the moon. the exterior was makeshift almost there's a whole myth behind this. what was surprising to me was that the visitors were all very young! unlike singapore where most youngsters don't really believe in superstition anymore.

after that we headed to da dao cheng visitor center where the tour concluded. it was a pretty good tour and i enjoyed myself! considering it is tip-based/free, i would recommend it. i tipped 500NTD and then left.

since i was feeling a little hungry i walked to the nearby ningxia market. i had the nicest muah chee 50ntd there so far 9/10!, but nothing else caught my eye. the variety wasn't super huge i guess, and the food is less gimmicky so there were more stalls of the same thing to serve the locals.


## Ximending at night.

Ximending at night is such a different vibe. The streets are bustling, the buskers are hustling, while locals and tourists alike are shuffling through the alleys, soaking in the vibrant atmosphere of Ximending.




was deliberating between shilin or going back to ximending and i decided on xmd because i was so tired from the walking already. but i still walked 30min back from ningxia to ximengding lol. ate a chicken sausage from a random street stall 50ntd, 5/10, didnt finish it. there were some buskers starting to perform so i got more food while watching them. found the min jiang kueh or stall! tried the peanut sesame and chocolate flavour. i think singapore's mjk are much better haha. 5.5/10. taipei's tastes more like a crepe and isn't so fluffy. or it could be i was just excited and expecting a lot and was naturally let down.
then had a cong zhua bing add egg for 45. pretty good! 7/10. though the cook was pretty gross saw him spitting inside his glove to lube his hands lol wtf? but it was still nice. 

wandered around watching a few more performances then headed back to the hotel around 8.45pm

ordered ubereats suan la mifen and hong you chao shou. 284 ntd. mala came instead of suanla, unsure if taipei differences or just wrong order lol. but still not bad. realise it's kinda more expensive than the other foods though haha. excited for rock climbing tomorrow!
