freren 


a sombre story about humanity, regrets and the ephemeral fragility of life

i couldnt get into it the very first time. this show requires you to have some sort of current outlook to life, and when first started watching it, i wanted something exciting, adrenaline inducing and thrilling. Frieren is the nothing of that. Frieren is about treasuring the present and not taking it for granted. The storytelling is melancholic and solemn, and the voice acting is almost monotonous, a world apart from the usual cutesy anime fashion 0
