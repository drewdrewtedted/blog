"The E-Myth Revisited" by Michael E. Gerber is often hailed as a must-read for small business owners, promising insights into why most small businesses fail and offering solutions to overcome common pitfalls. I had assumed that this book would provide some insight into the reasons behind the failures of small businesses. However, it seemed like the author has had a marking rubric of how businesses should be ran - and if those small businesses didnâ€™t follow said rubric, it would be exactly the reason why it failed. I had expected more analysis into common pitfalls of having a small businesses. There was close to no evidence or numbers in the book, just a whole lot of hypothetical and made-up characters - which is really ironic because something suggested was to have quantifiable metrics to gauge the success of a business. 

Published in 1986, this book suffers from outdated perspectives that are hardly applicable in the current globalized landscape. Gerber's insistence on the franchise model as the ultimate solution for small businesses overlooks the diverse nature of entrepreneurial ventures. While the franchise model may work for some industries, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The book neglects to explore alternative strategies and fails to acknowledge the unique circumstances of individual businesses, limiting its relevance to a narrow subset of entrepreneurs. Furthermore, he assumes that the idea of 'success' to small businesses is equivalent to mass expansion, as seen from his bias to the "Turn Key Model".

Read it if you must, but don't expect much. While most of the book was pretty much filler and fluff, it can still be slightly informative to business owners with completely no experience.
