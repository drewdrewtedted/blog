I'll always have a soft spot for Golden Sun - that game from my childhood, you know? Alongside Pokemon Emerald, these turn-based games were my go-to during train rides home from school. They didn't demand too much brainpower or constant attention, which was perfect for quick gaming breaks. As the years rolled on, I kept these classics close, thanks to emulators on iPhones. They were there for me during those late-night exam cram sessions, pooping sessions or when i needed a hit of nostalgia. Golden Sun wasn't about the action or the art for me. It was the fantastical world and the blissful exploration that provided a much-needed escape from the realms of mathematical formulas and inorganic compounds.

_Golden Sun vs Sea of Stars_

Anyway, when i heard that Sea of Stars was said to give off major Golden Sun vibes, i was excited to check it out. Sea of Stars is a classic turn-based pixel art JRPG. Just like in Golden Sun, the main characters are all about harnessing solar and lunar powers, which is a total nostalgia trip. The graphics and interface was also somewhat reminiscent of Golden Sun. In my opinion, JRPGs might not get your heart racing with non-stop action (turn-based combat and all), but they should more than make up for it with stellar storylines and strategical skirmishes.

_Warrior Cook Garl. Everyone wants a friend like him!_

In Sea of Stars, I liked its cute cinematic cutscenes that would happen mid-battle. It was a most welcome respite from the battle, almost like a little dopamine cookie the developers added to reward you. It was awesome there are almost no inventory management required, but i also found it puzzling that there wasn't a need for an inventory in the first place - you were mostly locked into one weapon choice at any point. The game impressed me with its unique and unconventional characters. I was particularly fond of Warrior Cook Garl's jovial and endearing nature - it was a shame that he didn't stick around for the whole story. 

However, the journey through Sea of Stars is not without its rough patches. The battles started feeling like a broken record after a while â€” repetitive and lacking the spice to keep me hooked. The absence of a minimap or a quest guide sometimes made me frustrated trying to figure out where to go. There was also no button to easily optimize or sell equipment. A 2x speed would've been a game-changer, injecting some much-needed pep into the battles that started dragging on and feeling like a battle of attrition. Let's not forget the map puzzles. They were supposed to be brain teasers, but they didn't quite bring the challenge I was hoping for. Instead, they fell flat, toeing the line of tedium.

_What exactly happened to the Fleshmancer?_

In my opinion, one of the most glaring issues in this game lies in its unsatisfying ending. That final boss not being the true puppeteer of the chaos? Talk about a letdown, it just didn't sit right. The "true ending" being locked behind a ridiculous collection sidequest seems totally unnecessary, considering that they could have just added it to the main story. There were also many loose ends hanging, such as the fate of Brugraves and the Dweller of Strife. They could have at least teased their fate after the credits rolled. I would be fine with a cliff hanger, but this felt more like tumbling down a slope of disappointment. A missed opportunity to tie up loose narrative ends and leave players with some intrigue or closure. 

In summary, "Sea of Stars" does serve a somewhat immersive narrative and exciting world that leaves you wanting more. Despite its faults, I still derived some enjoyment from playing it. I would recommend only if the price tag (29.99SGD) was lighter on the wallet. There's potential, but it could use a sprinkle of polish and a pinch of affordability.
