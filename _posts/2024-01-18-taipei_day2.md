I woke up excited for my second day in Taipei. I designated day 2 as a chill day since day 1 was supposedly tiring because of the day trip. The only thing on my itinerary today was a [free walking tour on Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/10199-free-walking-tour-golden-age-route-taipei/?aid=54315). Since I didn't have anything planned this morning, I decided to visit a community gym short walk 15 minute away in yuquan 玉泉. 


## Yuquan Gym (玉泉公園健身房) and Ximending (西門町) | 11am

The walk from my hotel to yuquan gym was leisurely and enjoyable. The gym was small but clean and new, and there were a few locals getting their workout in. I spent about an hour there, nothing too vigorous because i was feeling a little lazy haha. Considering it was only 50NTD/h, it was pretty worth it!

After my workout, i strolled back to ximending, enjoying the hustle and bustle of the morning taipei life. The day has just started for many shops in XMD.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/ahchung.jpeg){: width="230" height="355" .right} I noticed a brief line forming outside Ay-Chung Flour-Rice Noodle (阿宗麵線) and decided to join in for a small bowl. The unassuming simplicity of the dish was delightful, especially on this chilly day. The broth had a tangy kick, and the noodles were wonderfully tender. With each spoonful, a wave of nostalgic comfort washed over me. Though I couldn't help but wish for a bit more meat. While vermicelli (麵線/mianxian) is commonly associated with Taiwan, variations of these thin rice noodles can also be found in other Asian cuisines such as Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine, each with its own unique preparation and flavor profile. This particular bowl of vermicelli tasted similar to taiwanese vermicelli in Singapore.

I spent some time exploring ximending with the intention of getting some soy milk and dough fritters (豆漿油條/doujiangyoutiao). It's a comfort food for many Taiwanese people, evoking memories of childhood breakfasts or early morning visits to local street vendors. In Singapore, it is not so much a breakfast food, but rather a snack. In addition, it is more common to just eat the dough fritter by itself, without the soy milk (at least in my experience). However, i was too late. Breakfast food apparently stops selling at 12pm. To make up for it, i got myself mango milk for 100NTD, but for its price i would honestly rather just get papaya or avocado milk.


<!-- after gym i went back to XMD. walked around and had this ah zhong mian xian for 60 ntd. not bad, 7/10. the day has just started for many shops and i saw an older guy do his morning prayers outside his shop. walked around a while more and came across this oyster omelette place. i think its way too much for me so i didnt get it. had mango milk for 100ntd, not bad 7/10 but kinda expensive. wandered around a while more, and wanted to get doujiangyoutiao. but it was too late! (12pm). shall try to return earlier next time.  -->



![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/pork_sausage.png){: width="230" height="250" .right} 

My day so far has been really pleasant. It might be the cool breezy weather which humid Singapore sorely lacks, or the amicable gracious vibes of taipei, but navigating the roads on food here is lovely. Pet/street dogs are common and seem to be loved and accepted by the locals. I went searching for more food and tried out a pork sausage. A little too oily for my liking, but it was still an enjoyable sinful treat. 

Storytime! I wasn't satisfied with the tiny bowl of luroufan yesterday, so i decided to give it another chance. I followed this billboard to a secluded corridor in a nondescript building. Save for a granny and her bulldog, there wasn't anyone else so I was wondering if i had went the wrong way. I stepped uncertainly into the corridor looking for the luroufan. The granny made conversation and told me that told me that the shop was actually just down the corridor, but luroufan wasn't on the menu anymore anymore. She, however, did recommend a better alternative, Braised Pork Belly rice (紅燒肉飯/hongshaoroufan)! According to her, the braised meat are a lot chonkier, making it more filling and satisfying. she ain't wrong.

After some pleasant chitchat with her (she was really nice), i made a turn down the corridor to discover a quaint little shop, and ordered the hong shao rou fan for 90 NTD. the larger portion size is more satisfying and fills you up better, but taste-wise it is similar to lu rou fan. 

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/xingfutang_xlb.gif){: width="200" height="250"}_XLB shop with beautiful lanterns_

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/xingfutang_xlb.jpeg){: width="200" height="250" .left} Up next was xiao long baos from the xingfutang collaboration. If you didn't already know, xingfutang is a popular bubble tea shop in taiwan. I'm not a huge fan of bubble tea, but the resulting creation from the collab was a xiao long bao filled with bubble tea and brown sugar pearls lol. I wanted to give it a try but it was sold out, so i got the normal ones instead. The broth and skin were pretty mediocre, you can probably easily find better XLBs elsewhere.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/shiba_manga_store.gif){: width="200" height="250"}_Cute shiba in the manga store_

I wandered around a while more and happened onto this manga/anime store selling merch from popular animes. Level 1 and 2 were mostly mangas-centric, while level 3 had figurines and collectibles from popular animes like demon slayer/jujutsu kaisen. Surprisingly, I found "made in abyss" merch! I was unaware that "made in abyss" was popular enough to even have merch lol. I ended up buying a nanachi blind box plushie for 320NTD (which i regret) and a nanachi figurine for 1130NTD  (which i don't regret). After that, i returned to my hotel at 2 for a quick shower before realizing my walking tour was at 3pm.

 
## Golden Age Walking Tour

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/tour_meeting_point.gif){: width="200" height="250"}_Meeting point at Beimen Station_

I had found this [free walking tour on Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/10199-free-walking-tour-golden-age-route-taipei/?aid=54315) before my trip and thought it would be nice to explore the area with a guide. I had nothing to lose anyway. At 2.40pm, I quickly walked from my hotel to beimen station for the walking tour. I won't go into full details here, but you should definitely check the tour out! I enjoyed it tremendously and my guides were very friendly. The tour was an introduction to a small piece of history of Taipei and was pretty interesting to me.


### Taipei Post Office

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/post_office.gif){: width="500" height="250"}_Taipei Post Office_

The [Taipei Post Office](https://g.co/kgs/wuFqo8G) is a Baroque style building, meaning it is influenced by western architectures and is unlike other buildings in Taipei. Today, it is a simple post office that closes late at 9pm, apparently to cater to the last-minute postal submissions of many Taipei students. However, this majestic building boasts a lot of history as it has been around since the Japanese invasion of Taipei.


### Fa Chu Kung Temple (臺北法主公廟)


![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/fachukung.gif){: width="200" height="250"}_I actually forgot the name of this temple. Lucky the location was tagged!_


![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/temple_praying.gif){: width="500" height="250"}_A devotee doing her prayers_

The Fa Chu Kung temple is one of many temples in Taipei. However, this particular temple has an unusual design. Most temples start on the ground floor but the Fa Chu Kung Temple had a road passing through the ground floor. The story is that the Taipei administration wanted to build a road through where the temple was, so they wanted to relocate the temple. Divination tools (Jiaobei/moon blocks) were then used to communicate with the god, and he did not want to be moved. Therefore, the compromise was to raise the god so that the road could be built. 

One guy came forward to ask the god a question using the moon blocks, and he got the same ["laughing answer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaobei#Practice) 3 times! 

### White Terror/228 incident


![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/white_terror_teahouse.gif){: width="200" height="250"}_The Tianma Tea House which led to the uprising by the Taiwanese people_

Considering i am no historian, I feel like attempting to give a summary here would be doing a disservice to what actually happened. So i'll just link the wikipedia pages for information. The [White Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_(Taiwan))  was a period of political repression of the Taiwanese people. One particular incident was the [228 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_28_incident) which was ignited when a government officer shot a bystander at the Tianma Tea House. Now, the [Tianma Tea house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianma_Tea_House) is an important landmark and is on the route for the yearly commemorative march.


### Yong Le

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/yongle.gif){: width="500" height="250"}_Hidden gem tucked away in Datong_

We made a pit stop at Yong Le Market, a small and quaint neighborhood far removed from tourists. Locals were just chilling by the road and soaking in the atmosphere. It is just generally a great vibe with laughter in the air.


### Taipei Xia Hai City God Temple

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/yuelao.gif){: width="500" height="250"}_Everyone here to pray for marriage lol_
We walked to temple Taipei Xiahai City God Temple where people pray to "old man under the moon" (yue lao), the god of marriage. there's a [whole myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Lao) behind this . What was surprising to me was that the visitors were all very young! Unlike in Singapore, where most youngsters don't really believe in superstition anymore. (edit: I had a chat with my older friends and they do know about yue lao, so i might just be ignorant.)

After that we headed to Da Dao Cheng visitor center where the tour concluded. it was a pretty good tour and i enjoyed myself! considering it is tip-based/free, i would recommend it. i tipped 500NTD and then left.

## Ning Xia Night Market


![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/muahchee.gif){: width="200" height="250"}_Best muahchee i ever had._

since i was feeling a little hungry i walked to the nearby Ning Xia market. i had the nicest muah chee (50NTD) there so far! The dough was ample and so soft. Paired with the peanuts, it was warm and comforting. There is also a cold version, but i prefer the warm one.

Nothing else caught my eye at Ning xia. There wasn't that much variety i guess, and the food is less gimmicky so there were more stalls selling similar food. I spent some time browsing the shops before walking back to Ximending.


## Ximending at night.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/busker_concat.gif){: width="500" height="250"}

Ximending at night is such a different vibe. The streets are bustling, the buskers are hustling, while locals and tourists alike are shuffling through the alleys, soaking in the vibrant atmosphere of Ximending.


![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/random_chicken_sausage.jpg){: width="200" height="250"}_mediocre random chicken sausage_

There were some buskers starting to perform so i got more food while watching them. Got myself a chicken sausage from a random street stall for 50NTD, didnt finish it.  

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-18-taipei_day2/mjk.gif){: width="200" height="250" .left}

I was quite excited for taiwan's min jiang kueh, so i was quite happy when i found this street stall! tried the peanut sesame and chocolate flavour. Alas, i think the taiwanese version was wildly different is actually closer to a crepe and isn't so fluffy. I actually prefer Singapore's MJK a lot more. Quite a letdown.


Finally, I had a cong zhua bing (蔥抓餅), which is a kind of crispy pancake. Quite similar to crispy roti prata. It was pretty good! Though the cook was pretty gross saw him spitting inside his glove to lube his hands lol wtf? 

I wandered around watching a few more performances then headed back to the hotel around 8.45pm. Day 3 is gonna be fun and jam packed with activities.

1. Ay-Chung Flour-Rice Noodle (阿宗麵線)  - `7/10`. Classic dish.
2. Mango Milk - `6/10`. Nice but not worth the premium price

5. Muah Chee - `9/10`. Must try. I loved its simple but powerful taste.
