Having played Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler, I came into this game having similar expectations - that it would be a TRPG with a captivating story and fleshed out characters. The graphics are reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics -  composed using pixel art with heavy vignetting and shadows to set the sombre mood. I played Triangle Strategy on the switch and I am glad that I did. It just seemed like the sort of game you would play lounging in bed or on your sofa, instead of at your desktop with your mouse and keyboard. Triangle Strategy revolves around making choices that influence the story. There are overarching themes of religion, imperialism, geopolitical struggles and oppression.

_3 choices, 3 convictions [^footnote1]_ 

The game introduces 3 guiding convictions in the game - utility, morality and liberty. These are "personality values" that your character has, so to speak. The values are determined by your dialogue choices, which in turn help recruit characters to join your party. In most cases, there were always only 3 choices, so you kind of knew which choice would steer you in the direction you wanted. I didn't feel like these choices were hard or mattered much. Throughout my whole playthrough, there was only one time I was undecided. More on that later.

_Frederica can set fire to burnable squares_ 

My first impressions of the combat were pretty good. From the get go, the tutorial was already a little challenging and I found myself rushing to heal some characters. Character classes were pretty standard. Serenoa is a swordsman, Frederica is a pyromancer, and Geela is a healer. Pretty standard combination of a warrior, mage and cleric. Attack animations had its own cute charm and could be sped up using R1. Battles weren't repetitive to the point of tedium, and it allowed for different strategies. You could build your team around environmental conditions such as burning tiles, frozen squares, clear or windy weather. There was a little grinding required for levels, gold and items, but it wasn't excessive. My only wish would be that the "mental mock battles", which is what you used to train your characters, had a randomized map. All in all, I felt that the combat system was pretty well done.

_Of all of Frederica's 6 active skills (not shown), only scorch and burning chains were consistently used[^footnote2]._

More niche characters would join your party as your conviction values increased. For instance Jenn, the artisan, could construct turrets and build spring traps. Apparently, it is impossible to get the full roster of characters just from one playthrough. I was still pretty satisfied with my roster of characters.  Many characters were kind of randomly thrown in with no significant relation to the main story. I am okay with that I guess, but it just feels a little out of place. Some characters were also clearly overpowered, so there isn't much class balancing. For instance, Anna the assassin could attack twice every turn. As a result, she leveled up way faster than the other characters because each action gives experience points. The list of skills each character could used were also limited by their weapon rank and class advancement, which was in turn limited by advancement items. I felt the developers should have been less stingy with these because boy, many of my characters are still at weapon rank 1 when I finished the game.

_Enemies (red chess pieces) storming the castle[^footnote3]._

The main story is engaging and unpredictable. I shall not spoil it too much; you can probably read it everywhere else, but it centers on a geopolitical conflict over the salt controlled by a religious veneer. The narrative is immersive and the animated moving chess pieces does a great job at representing the actions of the kingdoms. Your choices added to your conviction values, but it does not feel like it changed the story. In Chapter 17, you are given a pretty hard decision, which will significantly influence the story's ending and remove one of the main story characters from your party. Personally, I couldn't get myself to choose haha, and I ended up just leaving it to the game to choose for me based on my conviction values. From what I read, all endings comes with both good and bad tidings, so I guess it is up to you to choose what you deem as a better ending. There is also apparently an ideal perfect "golden ending" which you had to choose specific choices earlier in the game.

The option to set the dialogue to be instantaneous is a huge win, and I loved that you could hold R1 to fast forward enemy actions. Battles were appropriately challenging without having to needlessly grind repetitively for levels. There were fun mechanics in battle maps and a variety of objectives that didn't just require you to go rambo and annihilate all the enemies. In addition to the combat, there is also an exploration mode. In this mode, you go around talking to NPCs to source for information, look for hidden items, or trigger dialogue that can raise your conviction values. This mode was sufficiently interesting and NPCs fed you little tidbits about the background lore of the story without trapping you in dialogue hell.

_40 hours flew past just like that_ 

My very first blind playthrough gave me 40 hours of gameplay. NG+ carries over your current characters and levels, but I don't think I have the patience to sit through the same story (for most part) again. In my opinion, flaws of this game aren't major and the whole experience was pretty much frictionless. I particularly liked that the villians weren't full out evil and actually had some sort of depth to them. I also loved that the endings weren't completely fairytale and that regardless of your choice, someone somewhere will have to suffer for it. Such is life you know. This game is extremely solid and definitely deserves a recommendation from me.
