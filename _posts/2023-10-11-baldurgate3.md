Remember those "choose your adventure" books? Instead of an actual game-master, the book dictates your adventure. I used to use an eraser as a makeshift dice, and used to be really into those when i was young and without access to a computer. Good times! At a point where my parents felt like they had my life figured out, those books provided me with some agency. Anyway, I digress. Tabletop games weren't popular among my group of friends or anyone i knew. Still, Dungeon and Dragons left its mark on pop culture and influenced TV shows like Stranger Things.

_Conversation is dependent on your background[^footnote1]_

Baldur’s Gate 3 is an video game based on a version of Dungeons and Dragons. It offers an immersive tale that captivated me from the start. Even though this is my first entry into the Baldur’s Gate series or D&D, the narrative is intricately woven into a meticulously crafted world and isn’t hard to follow. The story is heavily influenced by choices and actions, offering a plethora of unique experiences and outcomes. This game has extremely high replayability due to its diverse storylines and NPC interactions. When i say 'NPC interactions', what i really mean is that there are tons of interactions - kill, beguile, flatter, insult, pickpocket and so on. It is not those filler dialogue that you know, don't really mean anything.

_What race would you choose?_

The character customization is also a gem, offering an array of combinations in race, profession, and background. I tried to roleplay a high elf dark wizard who killed everyone (this was way too hard for my very first playthrough), and a rogue assassin (this was pretty fun) who you’d never see coming. There is also apparently a dark urge origin character which sounded really cool, though i didn’t get to play this before my patience for the game ran out. The possibilities for role-playing are infinite!

_Combat? fun and frustrating._


Baldur’s Gate 3's combat system had its quirks that left me a tad frustrated. Randomness seemed to have a field day, and I can't count how many times a swing and a miss made me want to pull my hair out. Battles dragged on longer than they should have, and it felt like needless stress. When cycling through the turns of each enemy, there would be random waits where the enemy would not move and I would just be sitting there bored to death. Inventory management also proved a tedious chore. Selling off stuff was like this never-ending game of deciding what's worth keeping and what's not. It took away from the overall fun. The ability to ‘save scum’ is also probably an intentional game design by the developers. On one hand, it saved my hide in tight spots, but on the other, it made me yearn for a more authentic experience where my choices were final, just like in the real world.

I ended my playthrough at the start of Act 2. Even then, Act 1 alone gave me over 40 hours of play time. Time just flew by, and hey, suddenly it's midnight and you're knee-deep in the story. I commend this game for its top-notch world building and high strategy and skill ceiling potential. I was considering putting a spoiler tag but honestly, Baldur’s Gate 3 is like this deep, expansive ocean of a game, and there's just so much to uncover that it's hard to truly spoil it. Despite the hiccups and the occasional frustration, the enchanting world of Baldur’s Gate 3 makes it an adventure worth undertaking.
