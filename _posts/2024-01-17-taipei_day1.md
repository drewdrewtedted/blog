For my very first day in Taipei, I booked a [guided day tour on Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/76306-yehliu-jiufen-shifen-golden-waterfall-day-tour/?aid=54315) to Yehliu Geopark, Jiufen, Shifen, and the Golden Waterfall. However, I couldn't find the meetup spot and missed the tour lol. In all honesty, it was my mistake for not arriving earlier, and the driver even waited for me for 15 minutes. Turns out I was at the wrong building in Taipei Main Station. So, I decided to do the tour solo.


## Jiufen Old Street (九分老街) | 11am




![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/jiufen.gif)_Jiufen. SO beautiful. Spent some time here soaking in the views and enjoying the breeze._

Nestled amidst the lush hills of northern Taiwan, Jiufen is a picturesque town with a rich history and enchanting charm. Originally established during the Qing Dynasty, Jiufen gained prominence in the early 20th century when it became a bustling gold mining hub. The town's name, which translates to "nine portions" in Chinese, is said to have originated from the nine families who first settled in the area. Jiufen reached its zenith during the Japanese occupation when it served as a major gold mining center, drawing prospectors and traders from around the world. Today, Jiufen is renowned for its narrow cobblestone streets, traditional tea houses, and stunning views of the Pacific Ocean. The town gained international fame due to its uncanny resemblance to scenes in the animated film "Spirited Away," contributing to its popularity as a must-visit destination for both locals and tourists seeking a nostalgic journey through time.

Google Maps worked pretty well. To get to Jiufen Old Street from Taipei Main Station, I had to take a direct train to Ruifang train station, then take a bus to the old street. Total time taken was about an hour.

Right out the Ruifang train station, I got myself a glass of papaya milk from a random local drinks shop near the bus stop to the old street. The natural sweetness of ripe papaya pairs harmoniously with the richness of fresh milk, creating a delightful and satisfying drink. It was actually a tad too sweet - I think they added sugar, so i will probably ask for less/no sugar in future drinks. Overall not bad!


Jiufen vibes were immaculate. I arrived around 11 am, and the absence of crowds at that hour added to the charm. Paired with the refreshing, cool breeze, strolling through the narrow alleys and perusing the market became an exceptionally delightful experience. Numerous snack stalls were interspersed among a diverse array of souvenir and craft shops.


### Random custard puff

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/custard_bun_concat.jpg)

My first snack in Taipei - a custard puff! The crust was flaky and soft, while the cream wasn't overly sweet with just the right amount of flavor. This snack probably isn't unique to Taipei though haha, i got it just because it looked appetizing. I continued wandering aimlessly and checking out the shops. 

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/dog_qipao.jpg){: width="350" height="355"}_They didn't stock for medium-large dogs!_

There are a few shops dog clothes littered throughout Jiufen. Since the Lunar New Year was coming soon, I bought a cute dog qipao (490NTD) for a dachshund friend. I also saw a red packet costume, but they unfortunately didn't have a larger size for Teddy. 

Jiufen is really capitalizing on the Ghibli fame. There are lots of Spirited Away merchandise for sale, many of which are small owl figurines. Taiwan in general sells lots of adorable goods and i was often very tempted to purchase them.

### Random braised pork rice (滷肉飯)

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/luroufan.jpg){: width="350" height="355"} _probably smaller than my palm haha_

My next meal in Taipei was a bowl of the famed luroufan. This simple dish features succulent, fatty pork belly that is braised to perfection in a savory and aromatic mixture of soy sauce, rice wine, garlic, and a blend of spices. The slow-cooking process allows the pork to absorb the rich flavors, resulting in tender and flavorful meat.

This is my first ever bowl in Taiwan, and the portion size took me by surprise. In Singapore, luroufan is usually a full meal, and here it felt more like a snack i could finish in 3 scoops. It was honestly very underwhelming, and the meat-to-rice ratio was very low. Still, the flavor was savoury and it did hit the right notes, i just wish those notes were hit for longer.


### Random handmade Ocarina shop
![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/ocarina_shop.jpeg){: width="350" height="355"} _assortment of handmade ocarinas with various designs. you blow through a hole somewhere to make a sound_

I ventured into a charming handmade ocarina shop run by an 80-year-old grandmother. She proudly asserted that all the ocarinas were crafted by her son and even graciously demonstrated how to play one. It's hard to resist the charm of an enterprising elder, although I can't verify the authenticity of her claims, especially since I spotted another ocarina shop selling similar items. Nevertheless, I couldn't resist and ended up purchasing a delightful cat-shaped ocarina for a friend.


### Grandma Lai's Sweet Taro Balls (賴阿婆芋圓)

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/grandmalai_concat.gif){: width="600" height="355" } _Grandma Lai's warm taro balls_

Given the chilly weather, I decided to indulge in a bowl of warm sweet taro balls from Grandma Lai. A steady stream of people could always be found gathered around the stall, savoring their small bowls of taro balls. The choice between the ice or hot version was presented, and naturally, I opted for the comforting warmth of the latter. Dishes like these, rooted in tradition, often embody simplicity and straightforwardness, yet manage to deliver an exceptionally delightful taste. While the flavor and texture of these taro balls were unfortunately somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the dish served its purpose as a comforting snack to ward off the cold.

### Ah Zhu Peanut Ice Cream (阿珠雪在燒)

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/ahzhu_concat.gif){: width="600" height="355" } _Grandma Lai's warm taro balls_

Moving on, I decided to try the renowned Ah Zhu peanut ice cream roll. This unique treat involves ice cream encased in a layer of peanuts and coriander, all neatly bundled within an edible spring roll wrapper. Whether Ah Zhu was the originator of these rolls or simply the most renowned remains uncertain. There was a long queue which moved pretty fast, i waited perhaps about 10 min for my turn.

The overall combination struck me as peculiar. The coriander contributed an unusual herbal note to the sweet ice cream, while the peanuts introduced an unwelcome hardness to the melting texture. Regrettably, I couldn't bring myself to finish it, and it's safe to say I won't be opting for it again.



Once I felt satisfied with my exploration of the old street, I made my way back to Ruifang Station around 2 pm. Upon checking the schedule, I discovered that the next train to Shifen wasn't until 3 pm. I strolled around Ruifang for a bit, but the sights were limited. Eventually, I plopped down on an empty seat at the station and dozed off for a brief nap.



## Shifen (十分) | 3.30pm


![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/shifen_station.jpeg){: width="600" height="355" }_stuck here for a little_

Conveniently situated adjacent to the Shifen train station, Shifen Old Street welcomed me around 3:30 pm with a considerable crowd. In fact, it was so crowded that the train station overflowed, and I had to wait a good 5-10min to leave. Despite being smaller than Jiufen Old Street, much of its space was devoted to the releasing of lanterns. My priority was the Shifen Waterfall, which was closing at 4:30 pm.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/basil_crepe_concat.gif){: width="600" height="355" } 

The food stalls at Shifen were pretty similar to those at Jiufen. I spotted a basil double egg cake stall on the way to the waterfall. Its flavor was a curious blend of egg prata with a strong hint of basil—uncanny but surprisingly palatable. Not as challenging as the peanut ice cream ball, and I found myself actually enjoying it.



### Shifen Waterfall (十分大瀑布) 
The 30-minute hike/walk proved to be relatively easy, featuring some stairs along the way. Despite the presence of signs, there's still a chance of getting lost. Some roads are steep and without any shade from trees. While manageable during my visit, I could imagine it being less enjoyable in the summer months.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/not_the_waterfall.gif) _not the waterfall_

Once you get into the waterfall compound (you'll know from the noticeable crowd), the walk gets a lot more scenic. From this point on, you can pretty much follow the direction of the crowd to the waterfall viewing platform.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/shifen_waterfall.gif)_beautiful waterfall only hampered by the hugeee crowd_

The waterfall was really pretty and majestic. Compounded with the scenic views along the way, it was actually a worthwhile free activity. It was just way too crowded for my liking.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/exiting_the_waterfall.gif)

At 4:15 pm, I returned to Shifen Old Street to finish the exploration. There wasn't really anything much to do, so I idled around watching people release their lanterns. I found out the train back to Taipei was pretty late at 5 pm, and it was around 2 hours of travel. I didn't want to waste 2 hours waiting, so I decided to Uber back (1200 NTD/51SGD). It was well worth it. I took a short nap in my hotel, then went to Raohe Night Market at 8 pm.


## Raohe Night Market 饒河夜市 | 8pm

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/raohe.jpeg)_Raohe Night Market next to the Ciyou Temple_

Raohe Night Market, situated in the heart of Taipei, Taiwan, is a vibrant and historic night market. Established in 1987, the market is one of Taipei's oldest and has retained its traditional charm while embracing modern trends. The iconic Ciyou Temple, located at the market's entrance, adds a cultural and historical touch to the experience. While Raohe Night Market isn't as big as the more famous Shilin night market, I dare say it is the best night market in Taipei.

I arrived around 8 pm to find a bustling crowd, but it was pleasantly manageable.


### Michelin Guide Fuzhou Black Pepper Bun (福州胡椒餅)

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/pepper_bun_concat.jpg)
<!-- ![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/pepper_bun2.png) -->

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/pepper_bun.gif){: width="100" height="355" .right} 
 
At the entrance of the Raohe Night Market, I encountered the renowned black pepper bun, reportedly featured in the Michelin Guide. The queue was insane, but moved very fast so it wasn't a long wait. However, my experience was rather disappointing; the bun was tough, the meat inside lacked tenderness, and the overall taste was nearly nonexistent. It felt like I was biting into a rock, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

### Random Fried potato balls (地瓜球)

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/potato_balls.jpeg)

Continuing down the street, I encountered a stall offering fried potato balls, a snack available at various stalls along the way. Despite their cute and colorful appearance, they didn't particularly stand out. The ones I purchased were plain and lacked fillings, and the flavor was primarily starchy with a mildly crispy texture. Perhaps my expectation was influenced by a better version in Singapore.


### Pin Zhen Golden Cripsy Roasted Pork (品臻黃金脆皮燒肉饒)

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/siobak.gif)


Moving on, I indulged in what could arguably be the crispest roasted pork of my life. This dish undoubtedly stood out as the highlight of the night and even the entire trip. The skin was flawlessly crispy, the meat succulent and bursting with flavor—each bite left me craving more. Despite its relatively steep price of 200 NTD per serving, it was undeniably worth every penny. I contemplated going back for a second serving, but my stomach was pleasantly filled after a thorough exploration of the market. 


### Other random food
After that, I had a random chocolate donut, nothing spectacular. There are also many variations of papaya milk. I tried out avocado milk, which was slightly more pricey than the papaya counterpart. The avocado had earthy sweet notes which blended very well with milk. I liked it so much I got myself two servings. 

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/fried_chicken.gif){: width="150" height="355"} 

It was time to savor my first taste of fried chicken in Taipei, and it lived up to expectations. The chicken was remarkably tender, boasting a delightful crispiness, and the batter was coated in a sweet, caramelized honey sauce. The only minor drawback for me was the presence of bones—I'm not particularly fond of them in my food. I am unclear if this particular stall has a brand, but i believe there are a few of the same fried chicken only in Raohe Night Market.


![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/teddy_liondance.jpg){: width="150" height="355"} 

I found a street stall selling dog clothes! They finally had stock for larger dogs, so I bought a lion dance costume for Teddy. I was looking for a dragon lunar new year costume but they didn't have any.

### Muah Chee

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/muahchee2.gif){: width="250" height="355" } 

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2024-01-17-taipei_day1/muahchee.jpg){: width="250" height="355" .right} Muah Chee is a delightful and chewy snack that holds a special place in Southeast Asian culinary traditions, particularly in Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Originating from Hokkien Chinese cuisine, this popular street food consists of glutinous rice dough that is steamed and then cut into small, bite-sized pieces. The unique texture of muah chee is achieved through a coating of finely ground roasted peanuts and sweet powdered sugar. Muah chee, a kind of less chewy mochi, is a more prevalent treat in Taipei compared to Singapore. I decided to try the Taiwanese version, which differs slightly from the Singaporean one; Taipei muah chee incorporates sesame and peanut flavors. I really enjoyed it!


## After trip thoughts
Highlights of the day were Jiufen for the scenery/vibes, and Raohe for the food. Sadly, I think Shifen was a letdown. Too many people, too little space, and not many things to do. I probably wouldn't recommend visiting it. If you still want to, you can limit your time there. 

And oh, I wish I didn't miss the [guided day tour on Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/76306-yehliu-jiufen-shifen-golden-waterfall-day-tour/?aid=54315). The travel can be quite draining, especially when you still have to stand on the train after walking for a while. Not to mention that the train rides are irregular. You can be waiting up to an hour for the train to your destination! Having a tour bus solves that, but of course you will have less freedom to explore as you like. Despite that, the solo travel today outside of Taipei was rewarding and enjoyable.
