I watched The Brothers Sun expecting it to be a flop. Suffice to say, it came as a great surprise that i actually somewhat enjoyed the show[^footnote1], so much so that i binged it. While the series is not without its flaws, there are several things that hit it right off the bat for me. First off, there is a great deal of Mandarin dialogue, and the actors and actresses could actually speak Chinese. You have no idea how much i have yearned for this. Many times I would listen intently to the accents of the actors in western shows only to be let down with a poor imitation. Hell, I don't even need the accent to be from Mainland China. Give me Singapore Chinese. Give me Hong Kong Chinese. Give me Malaysian Chinese! I'll take it all! Listening to a bad accent is akin to listening to pieces of Styrofoam rubbing together. It's like listening to babies trying to speak for the first time, except that it's not cute. I am proud and overjoyed to say that in this show, no such offense was committed.

The Brothers Sun does a pretty good job at juxtaposing traditional Eastern customs with liberal Western mindsets. This is evident in the two brothers, Charles and Bruce. Charles grew up in Taipei and is the right hand man for his father, the head of a major triad. He is ruthless, loyal to his father and follows traditional triads customs. Bruce, on the other hand,  can barely speak mandarin, and is a pretty wimpy Americanized kid raised by a tiger mum. The show focuses on the brothers as they reconnect in the middle of a triad war.

_Ok this is a really bad image with the watermarks, but you get how traditional chinese gang fights were portrayed in eastern media[^footnote2]_

There is some pretty good fighting scenes that are reminiscent of old Chinese shows i used to watch. It was refreshing to see gang skirmishes with parangs and knifes, instead of guns which seems to be heavily used in American media.  Some light comedy is also thrown in here and there, nothing too hilarious.. The importance of familial ties is an overarching theme in the show. "保护家人" (baohujiaren) means "protect your family", and it is emphasized by the characters like some sort of family motto. It is a well rounded show, not too serious, while providing a good measure of entertainment. That said, don't expect a super tight plot. There are definitely many plot holes, but i didn't mind them too much.

Michelle Yeoh does a stellar job at playing the Asian tiger mum. Her commitment to her sons in spite of their disagreements embodied the quintessential tough love from an Asian mum. With her looks of exasperation whenever her sons screwed up, these scenes really resonated with me. Bruce on the other hand, was not a really likable character. I get that he's supposed to be that soft touch in a triad family, but man, he's just too wimpy. He's like Star-lord messing up the Thanos gank in Infinity War. Or like that project group mate who does nothing but throws in dumb suggestions. He could definitely have been written better to give him more depth.

If you have some time to pass, you should check out The Brothers Sun. Don't take the show too seriously and enjoy the ride. And if nothing else, enjoy the sufficiently accurate Chinese accents.
