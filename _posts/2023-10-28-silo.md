_The Silo Series[^footnote1]_

Silo is a tv serious based on Wool, the first short story of the Silo Trilogy by Hugh Howey. The show explores a post-apocalyptic world where a community of over 10 thousands stays in a colossal underground silo bound by strict regulations, all in the name of safety and survival. As secrets, mysteries and conspiracies unfold, the inhabitants must confront the harsh reality of their existence in a world poisoned by the outside. I did not read the book series, so my review will only be of the tv show, and not how faithful it is to the book. Rebecca Ferguson, of the Greatest Showman fame, stars as an engineer who becomes wrapped up in conspiracies and political plots. The show is less Maze Runner or Hunger Games, somewhat like Divergent and more Mortal Engines.

At its outset, the series appears to to grapple with its identity, leaving you uncertain about what to expect. The initial few episodes were action packed and with pacing akin to  The first episode introduces Sherrif Holston and his wife Allison. Child rearing in the silo seems to be via a ballot process - once selected, you only had a year to remove your birth control implant and get pregnant. Holston and Allison were lucky this year, and so they started on their repeated attempts to conceive. After a few months, they had no such luck, and the couple was getting starting to get frustrated. Gloria Hildebrandt, an overly well meaning fertility expert, plants in Allison seeds of doubt that she wasn't actually allowed to conceived by the higher ups - simply because she was a curious, resourceful person - traits that the overlords did not want in the community. So paranoia started to take hold of her, and one day, she surgically removed a birth control implant from herself.

She also proclaims that she wants to "go out". In Silo's law, that declaration means a one way ticket out of the Silo. And tradition dictates that if the outside is beautiful, the ousted would clean the external camera located at the exit of the silo. That camera was the only view the inhabitants had of the outside world, therefore it obviously meant a lot to them. So Juliette did just that, only to collapse a few moments later, leaving behind an angry and confused Holston.

The next episode begins another bombshell: Holston is getting ready to be sent out to clean. He goes out, cleans the camera, and then drops dead beside Allison. Presumably, there is a jump in the story, so a flashback begins. It was a little confusing to be honest. Holston meets an engineer Juliette whose partner allegedly got murdered. The down deep is basically where the Silo's pariah class reside, and hence with insufficient evidence and street cred, the case is closed without any resolution. The story telling is a little contrived and confusing in this episode, but it basically then follows Holston's journey to decide to leave the silo. After he cleans and collapses beside where Allison did, the Mayor finds out that Juliette was appointed as the next sheriff. A little weird that they barely know each other and suddenly she gets appointed. Anyway, over the next few episodes, people (including the mayor) start dropping dead, and Juliette has to prove herself to solve these mysteries. 

Sadly, i felt like the first few episodes were the most interesting, and actually explored the lore of the silo. The middling parts of the series were just a dragged out crime/detective/mystery show. I don't think the writing is bad, i just wished the show didn't start with such a strong pacing which then fizzled off. Because Juliette actually had so little screentime at the start of the series, it took me a while to realise that she was actually the main character, and the Holston and Allison would not be part of the narrative anymore. I wanted more silo lore, but many questions were still left unanswered. Why are magnifiers banned? Why are hard drives banned? There were no explicit answers and you were sort of required to infer the answers.

The show concludes with Juliette being sent out to clean. Her friends in the down deep has made a better suit which i suppose is able to better withstand the external environmental conditions. She steps out and in front of the camera, and drops the cloth in an act of defiance. She then takes a few steps towards the bodies of Holston and Allison. Unsurprisingly, she seems fine this time, thanks to the superior suit. The people in the silo observe her with newfound hope. Here's the kicker. Both Holston's and Allison's front displays from inside the suit displayed lush, verdant greenery, encouraging them to clean the camera. This was shown at the start of the series, presumably to make you think that the silo's inhabitants are living in one big lie. However, Juliette was able to make the suit display glitch out, changing the display from a beautiful green landscape to a desolate dead desert. As the camera pans out, it is shown that there are many other silos (season 2!). We just got reverse uno-ed.

_Reality: Life sucks. And it sucks for many other silos too.[^footnote5]_


Don't get me wrong. I liked the show. I did not read the book but i can tell that some parts of it were intentionally left out because of screentime constraints. Even then, it is a pretty decent series to watch to pass time. I wasn't glued to the screen or anything like that, but the show was mildly interesting enough for me to want to keep going. I will still watch Season 2, but i somehow have the opinion that the plot will be predictable. Let's pray that there's something to set Silo Season 2 apart! 

Edit: i just googled, and Season 1 is apparently only half of the first book. That explains why there feels like there is missing lore, rushed narratives, and characters that weren't fully fleshed out.
