{: .prompt-info }



It's kind of weird because I think I've seen Season 1 somewhere before, but this is my first time subscribing to Apple TV. Anyway, "See" is a story set in a world where everyone is blind. At its core, it's about a family – blind parents raising sighted children while navigating societal and religious taboos. It's not your typical dystopian setting; it feels more barbaric and backward, actually. Unsurprisingly, the main antagonist is a sightless evil queen who aims to rule by giving birth to sighted children. While the premise may seem simple and somewhat overused, "See" really shines when it comes to character development. Baba Voss, a strong father figure, is willing to sacrifice everything to protect his family, even his own life. Maghra, the loving mother, has a mysterious and secretive past and has given birth to two sighted twins. Haniwa and Kofun, the sighted twins, face challenges and conflicts as they deal with discrimination from a society that can't see. This discrimination threatens to tear their family apart. Even though both children started with nearly identical backgrounds, their experiences and upbringings lead them to become very different people by the end of Season 3. Overall, despite some slower (and sometimes ridiculous) moments, "See" makes for a worthwhile watch.

# Season 1

_Queen Sibeth: unhinged and self-serving_

Season 1 primarily revolves around Queen Sibeth's relentless pursuit of the sighted children. She seems to have convinced her Payan kingdom that she has received God's order and that only witches have the gift of sight. To aid her cause, she's assembled an army of Witchfinders who travel across the kingdom, instilling fear and extracting information from towns. This season, to be honest, felt somewhat average. It felt like it was mostly laying the groundwork for the subsequent seasons. Sibeth seemed to be wrapped in too much plot armor. There were numerous instances when I found myself thinking, "Come on, she can't be that fortunate." And speaking of that divine order, it turns out she speaks to God through masturbation and she bestows God's power to others through sex. Ew! Sibeth is depicted as this sneaky, deceptive and treacherous villain. At some points in the story, I wished she had a little good in her, but it seems like she was entirely driven by evil and self-interest. The writers were good at making me hope for her redemption arc, but sadly it never came.

_Alkenny: where Haniwa and Kofun grew up_

The idea of how the loss of sight can lead to a significant decline in both technology and society is indeed fascinating, and the show doesn't deliver a clear explanation. It's possible that widespread panic and chaos contributed to the collapse of technological infrastructure, but this isn't explicitly addressed in the series. Was it widespread panic that destroyed everything? If there are people who are able to resist the virus in the present, shouldn't it be the same back then? It's intriguing to witness how the blind have adapted to their circumstances, like using knotted ropes for messages. But what happened to Braille? I don't think knots can carry that much information with precision and accuracy. And then there's the whole heartbeat distance measuring thing, which seems a bit sketchy. I mean, everyone's heartbeat is doing its own dance, and in a battle, it is going to be wildly different from person to person. Why didn't they just go with regular old seconds to keep time? Would've been way simpler, I think.

# Season 2

_Kofun, Baba Voss, Maghra and Haniwa reunited_

Season 2 is where things start to get interesting and the pacing was a step up from slow Season 1. Maghra is revealed to be a princess. She tries to overthrow Sibeth, but Sibeth seduced her sighted nephew Kofun hoping to get a sighted child. EW!  Haniwa is taken by the Trivantian Republic. Turns out that Baba Voss is a Trivantian and now has to enter familiar hostile territory in search of his daughter. Maghra is forced into a marriage alliance with Harlan. That isn't all too bad considering Harlan is the typical good-guy jester. Battles were much more exciting this season - there were better strategies, and more advanced weapons. It was a far cry from season 1's battles with brute weapons. Haniwa is now proficient with a bow and arrow, while Kofun has still chosen to be a melee swordsman. He does cleverly make use of his sight to mislead and fool his enemies. At the same time, Haniwa espouses technology as a boon, while Kofun thinks it is humanity's bane. The differences in thinking between Maghra, Baba Voss, Haniwa and Kofun causes their relationship to be strained. At the same time, there is so much love. As Haniwa says: "They don't always understand. But I have never doubted for one moment that they love me."

_sighted kid commandeering a crossbow attack unit_

Season 2 ends with an exciting stand off between Baba Voss' camp and the Trivantians. Without their sight, the battles were sort of turn-based like. People couldn't dodge or evade attacks because, well, they couldn't see a thing. So, they'd strike and then just stand there waiting for the retaliation, relying on their opponents' movements to figure out where they were. Having sight definitely gave a massive advantage to those who had it. They used all sorts of tricks, like setting traps with napalm bombs and taking advantage of the environment like icy floors to drown their foes. It was a pretty clever move to have a kid directing crossbow attacks with a drum and shouting out orders – that was kinda cute. The episode finishes with a shocker. Sibeth silts Paris' throat. I think the writers were trying to go for a "Red Wedding" moment here, but honestly I thought this was actually overdue. I might be biased because I hated that Paris saved Sibeth at her execution by somehow detecting that she is pregnant. I mean, come on, it's only been a few days since they copulated. Let her meet her fate, right? By saving Sibeth, Paris killed thousands many others.

# Season 3

_Kofun holding his baby_

Season 3 ties up many storylines. Sibeth gave birth, but alas, the baby isn't sighted. The moment she found out, her motherly instincts vanished into thin air. Somehow, she managed to escape the guards (with some help from Kofun), survive in the wild without any weapons or food, and manage to meet the Witchfinders to rally them and get them on her side. It's almost like she had some invisible plot armor on. Speaking of Kofun, he has somehow managed to turn into this moody teenager with this constant petulant sulking face. I mean, you messed up. Own your mistake and move on. I really couldn't stand him this season. Meanwhile, the Trivantians managed to reengineer bombs which they plan to attack Pennsa with. Sibeth manages to seduce the Trivantian's leader with God's power again (ew), and together they demand that Maghra's surrender. The show culminates in Maghra finally working up the strength to stab her sister in the neck. Baba Voss sacrifices himself to set off the bombs by swinging his sword at them. Why couldn't Haniwa do this with some fire arrows? I guess having a dramatic ending hits you harder in the heart. After the battle, Haniwa sets off with her girlfriend to join the sighted people somewhere else, while Kofun decides to remove his sight so that he could better empathize with his blind peers.


# Thoughts

"See" has a solid storyline that delves into some significant themes, like the power of familial love, discrimination, and the influence of religion. It's always intriguing to explore how different characters and groups are treated in a world where blindness is the norm.  I kind of wished there was a character with additional disabilities, like a deaf-blind person. It would be interesting to see how people with additional disabilities would be treated differently from people with additional abilities (sight).

_just a stealthy shadow_

Some intriguing concepts, like the shadow, were introduced in the show which added an element of espionage and intrigue to the story. However, it's disappointing when such concepts are introduced but not further explored or integrated into the narrative. Similarly, the ideas of presages, scentier, and ayura are fascinating and could have added significant depth to the story. It's a missed opportunity when such unique abilities are used primarily as plot devices to steer the story in a particular direction without being fully developed or integrated into the overarching plot.

![](/assets/img/posts_images/2023-10-22-see/charlotte.png){: width="700" height="400" } 
_charlotte: lil fuckers_

There were also some random plot devices. Like, out of the blue, the sighted folks got themselves a personal security squad courtesy of a tribe known as the Compass. But hey, don't get me wrong, I absolutely adored Kofun and Haniwa's guardian, Charlotte. Her sassy attitude and quick wit were like a cool breeze in this otherwise super medieval, uptight world.

I particularly liked Sylvia Hoeks' Sibeth. Her performance made me really hate the character and she really did a great job at portraying this unhinged narcissistic queen. Sibeth speaks in a floaty voice with an accent much unlike any others in show. She drags her words  and her pitch oscillates randomly between high and low. It is a surefire way to make her presence known in a world where sound is so important. I wonder if this is a intentional choice by Sibeth, and if so, it would be nice to hear it come off when she gets emotional.
