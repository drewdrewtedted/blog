This is actually my very first entry to Studio Ghibli's films (yes, i know). While Studio Ghibli has had significant influences on the anime landscape, i just never bothered to watch it. Growing up, anime was Pokemon/Digimon, and I didn't really have exposure to films that weren't shown on the TV. It was only until Netflix happened that i really got into anime. With anime, it is simple. Simple enough to not to have to care about acting chops. Simple enough to rely on animation and voice acting to convey emotions and expressions. Most importantly, it is simple enough to tell a story unhindered by real life constraints. 

Miyazaki's The Boy and the Heron[^footnote1]  is no different. The film centers around Mahito, a young boy whose profound love and yearning for his late mother, Hisako, become the emotional core of the story. There are overarching themes of guilt, trauma, self-worth, with minor underlying Oedipus messaging. The encounters and elements in this magical world, seemingly perceived through the lens of Mahito, in the film are childlike, ethereal, and innocuous.

# Summary 

The film starts with Mahito, a young boy, being alerted to a fire. Tragically, his mom, Hisako, meets a heartbreaking fate as she succumbs to a fire at work. His father then sororate marries his late wife's sister, Natsuko, so Mahito's aunt became his stepmom. Hisako and his father relocate to Natsuko's estate. Natsuko takes good care of her new stepson, though this love does not seem to be reciprocated by a sullen Mahito.

Meanwhile, Mahito is not adjusting well to his new environment. In addition to getting into fights at his new school, he seems to be suffering from PTSD and a sense of worthlessness from being unable to do anything to save his late mother. He starts to hear a grey heron imitating his mother's cry for help. As the days go by, Mahito gets increasingly frustrated. The grey heron starts goading him into looking for his late mother, and Mahito almost gets swarmed by toads and frogs. Natsuko however arrives in the nick of time and shoots a whistling arrow at the grey heron, chasing them away. At this point, Natsuko's rescue implies some legitimacy to Mahito's heron-whispering experiences which are not merely in his head.

One day, Mahito spots a supposedly sick Natsuko disappearing into the forest. The whole estate goes on a manhunt for her, but Mahito has other ideas. He believes the grey heron has captured Natsuko, and he is determined to rescue to rescue her. While not explicitly stated, it is clear that Mahito has taken a liking to Natsuko, and is determined to do everything in his power to save his mother this time (This was later verified in the magical world where Mahito addressed Natusuko as mother 母 for the first time). With a steely resolve, Mahito goes to where Natsuko was last seen and tracks the grey heron down.

He finds a whole new magical world where he makes new friends, one of whom is his late mom's younger self. This magical world seems to exist outside life and death, and people/animals from different time periods exist in this space. This journey showcases Mahito's morals and good-naturedness as he navigates this new world fraught with enemy herons and parakeets. I will leave the meat of the show for you to watch (it's pretty good), but ultimately Mahito manages to save Natsuko. He also tells young Hisako to save herself from the fire, but young Hisako refuses for reasons not specified. To me, this was confirming that Hisako believes she should not change destiny and that her son is in Natsuko's good hands. Natsuko, Hisako and Mahito hug a final time, then they all return to their own time. A few years later, Mahito seems to have accepted Hisako's death, and is happier in his new family.

# Thoughts 

Since there are many symbolic elements, there are also various other open ended interpretations of this film. Many details in the film also seem to be autobiographical. I do wish Miyazaki did cut some plot elements out, but maybe that is just the charm of his films. I also felt that adhering to the Japanese title, 「君たちわどう生きるか」, which literally translates to "How do you all live?" would have been more appropriate and would also have added a poignant layer to the film. This title encapsulates a profound question about one's response to grief and trauma, as if Miyazaki is reaching out to us, asking how we navigate the complexities of life in the face of adversity. Likewise, Mahito's Japanese kanji is 真人, which is made up of the kanji truth 真, and person 人, and is also the [highest noble title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahito_(title)) in ancient Japan. This, to me, is Miyazaki's personal answer to the titular Japanese hypothetical.

I have a question though. Did Hisako and Natsuko remember their experiences in the other world? I feel like that would change things. What do you think about the film and what stood out to you? Let me know in the comments below!
