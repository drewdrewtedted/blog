> Rating: 3/10
{: .prompt-info }


I am generally quite lenient in my ratings, but this show got from bad to worse with each episode. What started as a supernatural mystery thriller with huge potential left me confused and wanting more. The story follows multiple storylines that are confusingly and erratically stitched together like a patched rag. There were also multiple plot holes, and an ending that was clearly set up for season 2.

_ok lol_

The main storyline follows Apollo, an eccentric antique bookseller, and Emma, a librarian. The first few episodes focus on how Apollo and Emma came to be a couple. Apollo courts Emma on the first date by screaming 'I AM THE GOD APOLLO', which might have been something that read better in the books but actually didn't translate that well onto tv. After a solo trip to Brazil, Emma reveals that she met a lady who gave her three wishes. It is then stated that her first two wishes were for a good husband and a healthy baby. Her third wish was not mentioned. Life goes on, and Apollo and Emma become parents to a baby boy called Brian. This is where things get bizarre. Emma starts receiving disappearing photos and messages of both her baby and Apollo. In case you are wondering, it is supernatural only because they were in the iPhone 3 era when unsending messages wasn't a thing yet. Anyway, this disappearing content makes Emma paranoid and suspicious, and she starts searching for solutions. While this is happening, model husband Apollo becomes more and more estranged from Emma's antics because, you know, she's clearly cray cray. One day, Emma and her sister went to collect a bag from a shady building. Guess what was in the bag? Chains. So you're telling me that the sister knew about the chains, and she didn't think to force Emma to seek help? come on. Anyway, the chains were used to tie Apollo up and then Emma killed the baby.

_Apollo goes to Emma's workplace in search of answers_


The next few episodes focuses on Apollo's grief and his search for answers. Emma has magically disappeared with no trace. Apollo does some stuff like bringing a rifle to Emma's workplace and going batshit crazy (which is really strange that he wasn't arrested). Anyway he had met this guy called William at some sort of grief group, and they together get up to no good. William reveals that he thinks Emma is on this hidden island, which is something like Themyscira of the Amazons, except that they were more recuperating refugees than warrior women. Both of them manage to get into the place, and well, they do get locked up by the island's Amazons. At this point, if you are like me, you are wondering where is the titular changeling. So, it turns out that baby Brian wasn't actually the real Brian, but probably a changeling (this wasn't explicit, they said it was an 'illusion'??). And William is part of this cult called Kinder Garten, and also isn't probably human. ok.. So what creature is William? No answers. Anyway, William commands "an army of men" to attack the island, but wait! the "men" are actually burly monsters that lurk in the shadows and never actually get shown! CGI costs are probably the scariest monsters.

_EP7: Lillian speaks to herself (and her past self) for one hour_


Time for an intermission. The 7th episode was the weirdest of all. Apollo's mom had the spotlight all to herself for this episode. I think the producers were trying out some experimental storytelling style where Apollo's mom went down a monologic memory lane and flashes of memory started playing on the walls and the environment. Initially i assumed it was draw some sort of parallel to some generational curse or crooked deal that was inherited by Apollo. Then, Apollo's mom started conversing with her past self? WTF?

_repeat after me: i am the god apollo!_

Back to the final episode. Cal, the Amazon's leaders, tells Apollo to distract the monsters. She sacrifices herself to buy time for the others by wrestling and killing William and then falling to her death. Apollo starts chanting his sutra "I am the god Apollo" and i guess that made him invulnerable and he makes it back safely. He goes to baby Brian's coffin and he realizes that it is indeed not baby Brian, but a replacement. okay but didn't Emma kill the thing already, why is it still crying? Anyway the show ends in a cliff hanger just as Apollo wakes a creature up. 


# Thoughts
What a pity. The first half of the show set the story up for so much potential. I wish that we got to see the creature. I wish the cliff hanger wasn't so bad. I wish they at least mentioned what Emma's third wish was. I wish Apollo would stop calling himself a god, it is honestly cringe. I wish many things but i guess we can't have it all. Not sure if i will be watching season 2 if it comes.
